# If this is set to true, URL session suffixes of the form ";jsessionid=..."

# A value representing the watchdog thread interval in seconds. The workers are
# maintained periodically by a background thread running periodically every
# watchdog_interval seconds. Worker maintenance checks for idle connections,
# corrects load status and is able to detect backend health status.
#
# The maintenance only happens, if since the last maintenance at least
# worker.maintain seconds have passed. So setting the watchdog_interval much
# smaller than worker.maintain is not useful.
#
# The default value is 0 seconds, meaning the watchdog thread will not be
# created, and the maintenance is done in combination with normal requests
# instead.

# A string value representing the error page url redirection when a backend
# returns a non-200 response. This directive can be used to customise the error
# messages returned from the backend server.
# The url must point to a valid server url and can contain format string number
# (%d) that can be used to separate the pages by error number. The redirect url
# in that case is formatted by replacing %d from error_page with the returned
# error status code.
